# About FOS

## Our Mission

**To democratize the value of digital art.**

FOS was built on a simple but powerful question:

> *What if a digital collectibles platform returned its value to the community instead of extracting it?*

Traditional platforms operate with a centralized intermediary ("the house") that captures the majority of value. FOS replaces that intermediary with **transparent, immutable code**.

We are building a non-custodial, self-sustaining protocol where artists, collectors, and community participants share value through verifiable on-chain mechanisms — openly, fairly, and without intermediaries.

## Our Philosophy: "Code is Law"

At FOS, trust is not placed in individuals, companies, or institutions. **Trust is placed in open, immutable mathematics.**

| Principle | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Black Boxes** | All core protocol logic is publicly deployed and verifiable on-chain. |
| **No Discretionary Control** | The team cannot pause the protocol, freeze assets, select recipients, or alter outcomes. |
| **No Custody** | Users never deposit funds into FOS. All interactions occur directly between user wallets and smart contracts. |

## Our Technology

FOS is not a traditional platform — it is a **decentralized protocol** composed of smart contracts deployed on the **Base Network (Ethereum Layer-2)**.

### Technology Stack

*   **Base Network (L2):** Fast settlement and low transaction costs while inheriting Ethereum's security.
*   **Chainlink VRF:** Industry-standard, tamper-proof randomness. Outcomes cannot be predicted, influenced, or manipulated.
*   **ERC-721 Standard:** Every Fos Digital Collectible is a true NFT — owned by the holder, transferable, and permanently recorded on-chain.

## The Cycle of 500

The FOS ecosystem operates in repeating cycles known as the **Cycle of 500**.

1.  Each cycle begins with the **first mint**.
2.  The cycle concludes with the **Green Eye** — the 500th collectible.
3.  The Green Eye programmatically triggers the protocol's **automated reward distribution**.

Each cycle functions as a closed, transparent micro-economy governed entirely by smart contract logic.

## Our Core Values

### 1. Transparency by Default
Every transaction, allocation, and protocol action is publicly verifiable on the blockchain in real time.

### 2. Protocol-Level Efficiency
The protocol operates on a minimal operational margin. After network costs and community allocations, only a small, predefined share is retained.

### 3. Privacy by Design
We intentionally minimize data collection. FOS does not request names, emails, or personal identifiers. A wallet address is the only identifier used.

## Join the FOS Community

FOS is not a financial product, investment platform, or game of chance. It is a **decentralized digital collectibles protocol** built for creators, collectors, and builders who value transparency, autonomy, and fairness.

**Mint. Participate. Collect.**
