# 6. The Affiliate Protocol (Referral System)

## 6.1 Architecture Overview
The Fos Affiliate Protocol is a decentralized growth engine designed to reward community expansion. Unlike traditional multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, this system is Single-Level and Linear, ensuring sustainability and preventing pyramid structures.

## 6.2 Activation Pathways
Users participate in the growth economy via two distinct on-chain methods:

**Method A: The Partner Route (Via Referral Link)**
*   **Mechanism:** A new user activates their account using an existing member's code.
*   **Cost:** $10.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas.
*   **Smart Contract Split:** The protocol automatically divides the fee:
    *   82% ($8.20): Allocated to the Referrer.
    *   18% ($1.80): Allocated to the Protocol Treasury.

**Method B: The Direct Route (No Referral)**
*   **Mechanism:** A user joins the platform independently without an invite code.
*   **Cost:** $10.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas.
*   **Smart Contract Split:**
    *   100% ($10.00): Allocated to the Protocol Treasury (as no referrer exists to compensate).

## 6.3 Commission Distribution (Pull Pattern)
To optimize gas efficiency and security for high-volume referrers, the protocol utilizes a "Claim-Based" (Pull) architecture for commissions.

*   **Instant Allocation:** Commissions are calculated and added to the referrer's on-chain balance immediately upon the invitee's transaction.
*   **User-Controlled Withdrawal:** Referrers may withdraw their accrued earnings at any time via the `withdraw()` function. This prevents "Dust Attacks" and reentrancy vulnerabilities associated with automatic push payments for frequent earners.
*   **No Human Intermediary:** The entire ledger is managed by the smart contract; the Admin cannot freeze, delay, or manually adjust earned commissions.
