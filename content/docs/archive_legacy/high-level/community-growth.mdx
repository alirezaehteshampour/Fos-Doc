# 7. Community Recognition & Growth Architecture

## 7.1 The Unified Ranking Protocol
To foster active participation, the platform implements a transparent, on-chain Activity Score for every user. Unlike simple counters, the ranking algorithm aggregates both growth contributions and protocol interaction.

*   **The Scoring Logic (Points System):** The smart contract assigns immutable points for verifiable actions:
    *   **Growth Factor:** +1 Point per valid Referral.
    *   **Participation Factor (Buddy Tier):** +2 Points per Entry ($3).
    *   **Participation Factor (Samurai Tier):** +4 Points per Entry ($13).
    *   **Participation Factor (Noble Tier):** +6 Points per Entry ($25).

## 7.2 The Global Leaderboard
*   **Real-Time Visibility:** The application features a public, real-time leaderboard that indexes all active participants. This ensures transparent competition and allows the community to verify the "Top Contributors" independently.
*   **Status & Recognition:** In its standard state, the leaderboard serves as a Reputation Protocol. It provides social proof and status within the ecosystem, recognizing top performers without altering the core economic distribution of the pools.

## 7.3 The "Campaign" Overlay (Conditional Incentives)
While the core leaderboard is designed for status, the protocol includes a Conditional Incentive Layer to accelerate network effects.

*   **Activation Threshold:** When the ecosystem reaches 5,000 Active Users, the "Growth Campaign" logic is automatically triggered.
*   **Milestone Rewards:** During active campaigns, the protocol redirects the Treasury's revenue share into a dedicated Prize Pool. Upon hitting defined revenue milestones (e.g., $20k, $50k), this pool is distributed to the Top 3 Leaders (50% / 30% / 20%) as a performance bonus.
