# 8. The Economic Growth Engine (Affiliate Math)

## 8.1 The "Fair-Share" Architecture
The Fos Affiliate Protocol eliminates the complexity of opaque, multi-level marketing schemes. It relies on a transparent, Single-Level Protocol Economy where rewards are mathematically fixed and verifiable.

*   **Universal Activation:** Participation requires a standardized activation fee of $10.00 (ETH Base).
*   **The 82/18 Immutable Split:** The smart contract enforces a hard-coded revenue division for every referral event:
    *   **Referrer Share (82%):** $8.20 is allocated directly to the inviter.
    *   **Protocol Share (18%):** $1.80 is allocated to the Operational Treasury.

## 8.2 Scalability & Yield Logic
The system places no cap on the number of active connections a user can maintain ("Unlimited Width"), allowing for exponential individual growth within a linear system.

**Unit Economics:**
*   1 Activation = $8.20 Net Yield.
*   10 Activations = $82.00 Net Yield.
*   100 Activations = $820.00 Net Yield.
*   1,000 Activations = $8,200.00 Net Yield.

## 8.3 Real-Time Settlement Layer
Unlike traditional affiliate platforms that rely on monthly "Net-30" batch processing, the Fos Protocol operates on Block-Time Settlement.

*   **Instant Allocation:** Earnings are recorded on the internal ledger immediately upon the successful confirmation of the invitee's transaction.
*   **Claim-Based Efficiency:** To minimize gas costs for power users and prevent reentrancy attacks, the system utilizes a "Pull" Withdrawal Pattern. Users may aggregate earnings and withdraw to their wallet in a single transaction at their discretion.
