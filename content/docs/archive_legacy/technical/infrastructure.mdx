# Infrastructure & DevOps
*   **Environments**: dev, testnet, production with dedicated RPC endpoints.
*   **CI/CD**: automated lint, test, and deployment pipelines.
*   **Observability**: centralized logs, metrics, uptime and error alerts.
*   **Secrets**: managed via vaults and restricted IAM policies.
