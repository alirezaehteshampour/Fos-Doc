# Growth Campaign

The Growth Campaign is a promotional incentive layer that activates when the FOS ecosystem reaches 5,000 active users.

---

## Status

**Current Status:** Pending activation (requires 5,000 users)

---

## How It Works

1. **Activation:** When FOS reaches 5,000 active users, the campaign automatically activates
2. **Duration:** 30-day promotional period
3. **Funding:** Protocol admin fees are redirected to a Community Allocation Pool
4. **Distribution:** At revenue milestones, top 3 leaderboard users receive promotional allocations

## Important Notes

- This is a **promotional campaign**, not a lottery
- Participation is **optional** and does not affect NFT purchases
- Allocations are based on leaderboard rankings at snapshot time
- The campaign is temporary (30 days) and does not affect core protocol
- Gas fees for claiming are paid by the user

---

## Technical Implementation

The Growth Campaign uses a dedicated smart contract:
- Admin funds the pool from protocol share
- Rankings are snapshot at milestone triggers
- Pull-based claiming (you must claim your allocation)
- On-chain verification of all distributions
