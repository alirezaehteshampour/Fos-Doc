# Glossary & References

Quick reference for blockchain and FOS-specific terminology.

## Blockchain Terms

### Merkle Proof
A cryptographic proof of inclusion in a set using Merkle trees. Allows verification that an address is in the allowlist without storing all addresses on-chain.

### Merkle Tree
A hash-based data structure where each leaf node is a hash of data, and each non-leaf node is a hash of its children. Enables efficient and secure verification of large data sets.

### Allowlist (Whitelist)
A curated list of wallet addresses eligible for restricted minting phases. Verified using Merkle proofs.

### VRF (Verifiable Random Function)
Cryptographic function that produces provably random outputs. Used for fair, auditable prize selection.

### ERC-721
Ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each token is unique and not interchangeable.

### ERC-1155
Multi-token standard supporting both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract.

### ERC-2981
NFT royalty standard allowing creators to receive royalties on secondary sales.

### Gas
Unit measuring computational effort on Ethereum. Users pay gas fees to compensate validators.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing code deployed on blockchain. Runs automatically when conditions are met.

### Wallet
Software or hardware for managing blockchain accounts and signing transactions.

### SIWE
Sign-In with Ethereum - authentication standard using wallet signatures instead of passwords.

## FOS Platform Terms

### Mint Phase
Specific period during which minting is available. FOS has three phases: whitelist, free mint, and public.

### Free Mint
Zero-cost NFT minting for eligible wallets. Limited to prevent abuse.

### Prize Pool
Contract holding rewards for distribution to winners.

### Prize Tier
Category of rewards (Jackpot, Gold, Silver, Bronze) with different values and selection methods.
