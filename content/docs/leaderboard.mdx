## How Rankings Work

### Real-Time Updates

The leaderboard updates in real-time as users complete qualifying actions. Your rank reflects your total accumulated points.

### View Options

- **Daily:** Rankings for the current day
- **Weekly:** Rankings for the current week
- **All-Time:** Overall cumulative rankings

### Tie-Breaking

If two users have the same points, ties are resolved by:

1. Higher cumulative Activity Score
2. Earlier on-chain activity timestamp
3. Lexicographically lower wallet address (if still tied)

---

## Growth Campaign Integration

When the Growth Campaign activates (at 5,000 users), leaderboard rankings determine promotional allocations:

| Rank | Allocation |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1st Place | 50% of milestone pool |
| 2nd Place | 30% of milestone pool |
| 3rd Place | 20% of milestone pool |

Allocations are distributed when revenue milestones are reached ($20k, $50k, $100k, etc.).

See full details in the [Campaigns documentation](/docs/campaigns).
