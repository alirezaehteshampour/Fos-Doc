## 1. Data We Collect

We only collect the following information:

| Data Type | Purpose |

| **Wallet Address** | The blockchain wallet address you connect to our platform. |
| **Social Account IDs** | (Whitelist Only) Temporarily processed to verify eligibility. |

## 2. How We Use Wallet Addresses

Wallet addresses are used exclusively for:

*   Facilitating NFT minting and purchases
*   Recording allocation and referral accounting
*   Supporting on-chain transactions and smart contract functionality
*   Optional analytics of on-chain activity **without linking to identity**

No wallet addresses are ever sold, shared, or used for marketing purposes.

---

## 3. On-Chain Transparency

Because all transactions occur on the blockchain:

*   Your wallet address and associated activity are publicly visible on **BaseScan** or other blockchain explorers.
*   This transparency is inherent to blockchain technology and is **outside our control**.

---

## 4. Storage & Security

*   Wallet addresses are stored securely and **cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties**.
*   We implement strong technical safeguards to protect against data loss or unauthorized access.
*   Data is retained **only as long as needed** to facilitate NFT and allocation functionalities.

---

## 5. No Third-Party Linking

We do not link wallet addresses to off-chain identities. Your wallet activity remains **anonymous** beyond blockchain transparency.

---

## 6. Your Rights

*   You may **disconnect your wallet** at any time.
*   Since no personal data is collected, there is no requirement to request deletion or modification beyond disconnecting your wallet.

---

## 7. Children

Our platform is **not intended for individuals under 18**. We do not knowingly collect wallet addresses or verification data from minors.

---

## 8. Updates

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices or regulations. The **latest version** will always be available on our website.
