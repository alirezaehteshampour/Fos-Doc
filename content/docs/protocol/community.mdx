# Community Recognition & Growth Architecture

## The Unified Ranking Protocol

To foster active participation, the platform implements a transparent, on-chain Activity Score for every user. Unlike simple counters, the ranking algorithm aggregates both growth contributions and protocol interaction.

**The Scoring Logic (Points System):** The smart contract assigns immutable points for verifiable actions:

| Action | Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| Valid Referral | +1 Point |
| Buddy Tier Entry ($3) | +2 Points |
| Samurai Tier Entry ($13) | +4 Points |
| Noble Tier Entry ($25) | +6 Points |

## The Global Leaderboard

**Real-Time Visibility:** The application features a public, real-time leaderboard that indexes all active participants. This ensures transparent competition and allows the community to verify the "Top Contributors" independently.

**Status & Recognition:** In its standard state, the leaderboard serves as a Reputation Protocol. It provides social proof and status within the ecosystem, recognizing top performers without altering the core economic distribution of the pools.

## The "Campaign" Overlay (Conditional Incentives)

While the core leaderboard is designed for status, the protocol includes a Conditional Incentive Layer to accelerate network effects.

**Activation Threshold:** When the ecosystem reaches 5,000 Active Users, the "Growth Campaign" logic is automatically triggered.

**Milestone Rewards:** During active campaigns, the protocol redirects the Treasury's revenue share into a dedicated Allocation Pool. Upon hitting defined revenue milestones (e.g., $20k, $50k), this pool is distributed to the Top 3 Leaders (50% / 30% / 20%) as a Promotional Recognition Allocation. Participation in campaigns is optional and unrelated to NFT purchase consideration.

## Launch Strategy & Growth Incentives

### The Access Protocol (Genesis Whitelist)

To honor the founding members who help build the foundation of the ecosystem, the protocol enforces a "Proof of Contribution" whitelist. This is not just a list; it is a gratitude mechanism designed to identify and reward true community builders.

**Eligibility Requirements (Social Validation):** To qualify as a Founding Member, users must demonstrate active engagement across the official communication channels. The smart contract and API verify subscription and contribution on:

- **X (Twitter):** Following and engaging with protocol updates.
- **Discord:** Joining the server and contributing to community discussions.
- **YouTube:** Subscribing to the official channel for educational content.
- **Telegram:** Joining the announcement and chat groups.

**The "Founding Member" Status:** Upon successful verification of these social actions, users are granted a specific Verified Role within the Discord server. This role serves as a badge of honor, distinguishing early contributors from the general public.

**The Reward (Exclusive Access):** Possessing this status is the only key to unlocking the Free Mint Phase. It ensures that the "Gas-Only" mints are reserved exclusively for the real people who helped grow the community, rather than bots or random speculators.

### The Genesis Allocation (Free Mint)

The "Free Mint" is a designated protocol phase engineered to reward early network validators.

**Gas-Only Participation:** During this specific window, whitelisted participants may mint Fos Digital Collectibles by paying only the network gas fee. The standard protocol revenue requirement is waived.

**Early Adopter Bonus:** The contract includes a deterministic "First-Mover" mechanism. The first set of unique wallets (e.g., the first 10 confirmed transactions) are programmatically upgraded to receive a special allocation of higher-tier units (e.g., Tier 3 "Noble" assets), locking in long-term value for the earliest supporters.

### The Hyper-Growth Campaign (Conditional Layer)

While the core protocol operates perpetually, a Conditional Incentive Layer is embedded in the smart contract to accelerate network effects post-launch.

**Activation Trigger:** This layer remains dormant until the ecosystem reaches a critical mass of 5,000 Active Users. Once this on-chain threshold is met, the campaign automatically activates.

**The "Revenue-Share" Mechanism:** Upon activation, the protocol enters a 30-Day Growth Phase. During this period, the "Protocol Share" of revenue is redirected into a dedicated Community Reward Pool.

**Milestone Distribution:** As the pool accumulates value, payouts are triggered at pre-defined milestones (e.g., $20k, $50k, $100k).

**Performance Allocation:** These funds are distributed to the Top 3 Community Leaders based on the real-time leaderboard, following a strict 50% / 30% / 20% split.
