# FOS Protocol Overview

**Project Name:** FOS

**Platform:** A digital collectibles platform offering NFT sales with optional, protocol-defined promotional distributions that are deployed on Ethereum Base with Layer 2 support.

Three distinct protocol-defined allocation pools corresponding to three NFT price tiers (FOS Buddy, FOS Samurai, FOS Noble).

Users purchase uniquely generated Fos Digital Collectibles. This purchase automatically activates the protocol's trustless Promotional Distribution Logic, which applies a 'Participation Weighting (Non-Financial)' to recognize and reward early buyers.

The system identifies recipients based on the Original Minter's Provenance (Initial Wallet ID + Unique Hash). This unique architecture ensures that reward eligibility is a permanent Loyalty Perk for the original buyer, remaining valid even if the NFT is later sold.

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

**NFT Standard (ERC-721):** The protocol implements the ERC-721 standard on the Base Network to ensure universal compatibility with wallets and marketplaces.

**Immutable Uniqueness:** Each Fos Digital Collectible is cryptographically unique, with metadata permanently stored on decentralized file systems (IPFS/Arweave).

**Incentive Vector (The "Early Adopter" Weighting):** To reward protocol loyalty, the smart contract enforces a Weighted Probability Mechanism:

- **Tier A (Mints 1–100):** These units are assigned a Double Weight Protocol Score (2x), mathematically doubling their allocation probability in the reward algorithm.
- **Tier B (Mints 101–500):** These units carry a Standard Protocol Score (1x).

**Immutable Logging:** This weight is assigned atomically at the moment of minting and is permanently recorded in the contract state.

### Algorithmic Recipient Selection

**Provenance-Based Eligibility:** Reward rights are derived strictly from the Original Minter's Provenance. The protocol binds eligibility to the initial wallet address and the NFT's unique hash.

**The "Green Eye" Trigger (Automated Execution):** The cycle is designed for autonomy. When the 500th unit (The Green Eye) is minted, the smart contract automatically executes the distributeRewards() function in the same transaction block.

**Verifiable Randomness (Fairness Mechanism):** The protocol utilizes Chainlink VRF exclusively as a fairness and anti-manipulation mechanism to automate recipient selection.

### Autonomous Capital Flow & Gas Logic

**Atomic Revenue Split:** Upon every transaction, the smart contract performs an immediate separation of funds to ensure the Reward Pool is always fully solvent before operation costs are covered.

| Tier | Locked for Rewards |
| :--- | :--- |
| FOS Buddy | $2.00 |
| FOS Samurai | $10.00 |
| FOS Noble | $20.00 |

## Detailed Process Flow

### User Journey & Protocol Interaction

**Pre-Mint Visualization:** Prior to execution, the interface renders a preview of the specific NFT attributes (Tier/Collection) to ensure transparency.

**Immutable Consent:** The user executes a one-time signature to acknowledge the protocol terms.

**Atomic Settlement:** Upon confirmation, the user transmits the NFT price (Native ETH). The smart contract atomically mints the asset and registers the buyer's Immutable Provenance.

### Special Access: The Gas-Only Protocol

To democratize access and maintain standardized cycle progression, specific sequence identifiers are designated as "Gas-Only Entries."

**The Designated Tiers:** Mints #10, #100, #200, #300, and #400 of every cycle are exempt from the protocol fee.

**The Mechanic:** For these specific transactions, the smart contract logic bypasses the pricing requirement. The user is required to pay only the Base Network Gas Fee to execute the mint.

### Provenance Registration & Scoring

**Minting Event:** The contract generates a unique tokenId and cryptographically binds it to the minter's address.

**Incentive Scoring:** The protocol automatically assigns the Participation Weight:
- Mints 1–100: Assigned a 2x Priority Score (Early Adopter Bonus).
- Mints 101–500: Assigned a 1x Standard Score.

### The Autonomous Distribution Cycle

**The "Green Eye" Trigger:** The cycle is strictly capped at 500 units. The purchase of the 500th NFT (The Green Eye) acts as the Atomic Trigger.

**Verifiable Selection:** The contract invokes Chainlink VRF to secure a tamper-proof random seed.

**Push-Based Settlement:** For the Reward Pool, the smart contract executes Direct Push Transfers, sending ETH automatically to the Recipient wallet addresses.

**Cycle Reset:** Post-distribution, the cycle ID increments, and the pool resets to 0, ensuring the system runs perpetually without manual intervention.

## Implementation & Security Architecture

### Smart Contract Engineering

The core logic is deployed on Base (Ethereum L2), utilizing industry-standard libraries to ensure asset safety.

**Gas Optimization:** The contract logic is heavily optimized for low-cost execution.

**Reentrancy Protection:** All financial interactions are guarded by nonReentrant modifiers and adhere to the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern.

**Governance Security (Multi-Signature Control):** All high-level protocol controls are protected by Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Governance.

### The Decentralized Failover (Public Retry Protocol)

**The Scenario:** In the rare event that the 500th mint transaction runs out of gas or reverts due to network volatility, the cycle effectively "pauses" rather than breaking.

**The Solution:** The retryDraw() function becomes callable by any public wallet. This allows the community to manually trigger the pending distribution.

### The Non-Custodial Interface

**Transparency:** The user dashboard provides real-time visualization of the on-chain ledger.

**Self-Sovereignty:** At no point does the platform take custody of user funds.

**The Verification Registry (Anti-Counterfeit Layer):** Fos deploys a dedicated Verification Smart Contract to protect users from secondary market scams.
