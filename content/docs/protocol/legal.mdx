# Strategic Framework & Legal Identity

## Brand Identity

**Visual Identity:** The Fos Brand Symbol serves as the visual ambassador, symbolizing adaptability and regeneration within the Web3 ecosystem.

**Target Demographic:** The platform is engineered for Web3 natives, Digital Collectors, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) participants seeking a trustless reward protocol.

## Product-First Disclaimer

The Fos Digital Collectible is sold as a standalone digital product. Any promotional distribution is ancillary, optional, non-guaranteed, and not consideration for purchase.

## Strategic Nomenclature (Safe Harbor Terminology)

To accurately reflect the protocol's legal status as a Product-Sale with Incentives (and not a gambling platform), the following terminology is strictly enforced across all documentation and interfaces:

- "Reward Distribution" (Not "Prize Pool" or "Lottery").
- "Fos Digital Collectible" (Not "Ticket").
- "Recipient" (Not "Winner").
- "Protocol Activation" (Not "Bet" or "Wager").
- "Automated Selection" (Not "Game of Chance").

## Regulatory Compliance & Consumer Protection

**Data Privacy:** The platform architecture is designed for data minimization. No personal identifiers (Names, Emails, IPs) are stored on-chain; only public wallet addresses are utilized, aligning with GDPR and CCPA principles regarding pseudonymity.

**Risk Disclosure:** Users are presented with a comprehensive Risk Disclaimer regarding the nature of cryptocurrency assets and the immutability of blockchain transactions prior to interaction.

**Legal Basis:** The Fos Protocol operates as a peer-to-peer distribution mechanism. It is not a "House" that users play against; it is an automated software utility that routes value between participants based on pre-defined, audited rules.

**Geographic Availability Notice:** The Fos Protocol is not available to users located in or residents of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the European Economic Area. Access from these jurisdictions is unauthorized.

**Technical Enforcement:** The protocol utilizes Edge Middleware (e.g., Cloudflare) to enforce IP-based blocking. Access is strictly denied for requests originating from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and the European Economic Area (EEA).

# Official Protocol Disclaimer

## No Financial Advice or Investment

Fos Digital Collectibles are sold strictly as consumer goods for artistic and social utility. No information on this platform constitutes financial advice, investment advice, or a recommendation to buy. You agree that you are purchasing an NFT with **no expectation of profit**, dividends, or capital appreciation.

## Non-Gambling (Promotional Nature)

The Protocol's "Reward Distribution" is an automated, ancillary **loyalty mechanism** designed to reward community participation. It is **not** a lottery, sweepstakes, wager, or game of chance. Participation is incidental to the purchase of the NFT product.

## The "Green Eye" Gas Risk (Critical Warning)

You acknowledge that gas fees on the Base Network fluctuate. Specifically, **the 500th transaction of any cycle ("The Green Eye") triggers complex contract execution, resulting in significantly higher gas costs (~18x standard).** By initiating a transaction, you voluntarily accept the risk that you may be the 500th minter and bear this cost. Gas fees are paid to network validators, are non-refundable, and are outside the Fos Team's control.

## Restricted Jurisdictions

This Protocol is **NOT** offered to persons or entities resident in the **United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, or the European Economic Area (EEA)**. Accessing the Protocol from these jurisdictions is a violation of our Terms and is strictly prohibited.

## Smart Contract Autonomy

Allocations are governed entirely by immutable smart contract code. The Fos Team cannot modify, influence, or reverse any outcome. You acknowledge that blockchain software is experimental and carries inherent risks, including code vulnerabilities or network failure.

## Limitation of Liability

By interacting with the app, you agree to hold the Fos Team, developers, and affiliates harmless for any losses, including failed transactions, high gas fees, or smart contract exploits. **Use at your own risk.**

# Refund & Claim Policy

## No Refunds (Digital Content Waiver)

**ALL SALES ARE FINAL.** Due to the immutable nature of blockchain transactions, payments cannot be reversed once processed.

**Waiver of Withdrawal Rights:** You expressly acknowledge that by initiating the Mint transaction, the **performance of the digital service begins immediately**. You hereby **waive your right of withdrawal** (cooling-off period) under applicable consumer protection laws (including EU Directive 2011/83/EU). You lose the right to cancel the contract once the minting starts.

## Gas Fees & The "Green Eye" Risk

Users are solely responsible for all network gas fees ("Transaction Costs").

**Non-Refundable:** Gas fees are paid to network validators, not to the Protocol. They are **never refundable**, even if a transaction fails or is reverted.

**High Gas Warning:** You acknowledge that specific transactions (e.g., the 500th "Green Eye" Mint) utilize significantly higher gas (~18x). By transacting, you accept this cost voluntarily.

## Allocation Claims

- **Automatic:** Cycle allocations (Buddy/Samurai/Noble) are pushed automatically.
- **Manual:** Growth Campaign rewards must be claimed manually via the dashboard. The Protocol is not liable for rewards left unclaimed due to user negligence, lost private keys, or wallet disconnection.

## Technical Failures

The Protocol is not liable for transactions that fail due to:

- **User Error:** (e.g., setting gas limit too low, "Out of Gas" errors).
- **Network Issues:** (e.g., Base L2 congestion or downtime).
- **Slippage:** (e.g., someone else minting the last item before you).

In these cases, no refunds will be issued for gas spent or opportunities lost.
