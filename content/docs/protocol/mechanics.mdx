# The Collection & Protocol Mechanics

## Minting Architecture & User Journey

The user journey is engineered to be a seamless, non-custodial e-commerce experience, grounded in strict on-chain verification.

**Protocol Interaction Terms:** Upon connecting, users execute a one-time signature to acknowledge the protocol parameters. This step ensures informed consent regarding the immutable nature of the smart contracts.

**On-Chain Minting (Source of Truth):** Users initiate the buyAndMint function to purchase a unique Fos Digital Collectible.

**Cost Structure:** The user pays the fixed NFT price PLUS the standard network gas fee required by the Base network.

**Pricing Oracle:** While the frontend interface displays real-time USD estimates via an API for convenience, the smart contract treats the Native ETH value as the absolute source of truth at the moment of execution.

**Account Abstraction:** The minting logic explicitly uses msg.sender rather than tx.origin, ensuring full compatibility with ERC-4337 Smart Wallets and future-proofing the protocol.

**Provenance Registration:** Every mint event atomically registers the buyer's wallet ID and the NFT's unique attribute hash on-chain. This establishes Immutable Provenance, ensuring that reward rights remain permanently attached to the original minter profile, regardless of secondary market transfers.

## Automated Revenue Allocation (The Zero-Sum Logic)

The protocol employs a "Split-Payment" architecture. Upon receipt of funds, the smart contract performs an immediate, atomic division of capital to ensure solvency.

**Protocol Rewards (The Community Treasury):** A fixed portion of every mint is programmatically locked into the Reward Contract. This capital is isolated and cannot be accessed by the Admin.

| Tier | Allocated per Mint |
| :--- | :--- |
| FOS Buddy | $2.00 |
| FOS Samurai | $10.00 |
| FOS Noble | $20.00 |

**Operational Margin:** The remaining surplus is routed to the Operational Sink. Unlike centralized systems that extract maximum value, this margin is strictly calculated to cover protocol maintenance, security audits, and development costs.

## Gas Sustainability Model (User-Funded Execution)

To maintain a perpetual, autonomous cycle without centralized maintenance, the protocol utilizes a tiered gas responsibility model:

**Standard Mints (1–499):** Participants pay the standard gas fee associated with their own minting transaction.

**The "Green Eye" Treasury (Mint #500):** The 500th NFT of every generation is designated as a Prestige Collectible with unique system responsibilities.

**The Mechanic (User-Funded Execution):** The purchaser of the Green Eye (Mint #500) acts as the Executor. They pay the NFT price PLUS the L2 Execution Gas required to process the distribution loop.

**The Trigger:** This transaction automatically executes the distributeRewards() function, closing the cycle and delivering value to all recipients in a single block.

**Atomic Revert Protection:** If the gas provided is insufficient, or if the contract lacks funds for the VRF fee, the entire transaction reverts atomically. This ensures the Green Eye is never minted without the rewards being successfully triggered.

## The Three Tiers (Pool Architecture)

The ecosystem is segmented into three isolated pools. Each pool operates on a 500-unit cycle, where 5 specific units (#10, #100, #200, #300, #400) are designated as "Gas-Only Entries" to ensure accessibility. This results in 495 Revenue-Generating Mints per cycle.

The following allocation values, percentages, and pool structures are hard-coded protocol parameters enforced by immutable smart contract logic. These figures represent system design constraints, not promises of individual receipt.

### FOS Buddy (Entry Tier)

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unit Price | ~$3.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas |
| Paying Volume | 495 Units (5 Free) |
| Protocol Revenue | $1,485 ($3 × 495) |
| Allocated Rewards | $1,000 |
| Ops Margin | $485 |

**Distribution Structure:**
- Primary Recipient: $500 (50%)
- Secondary Group (x6): $50 each (30%)
- Tertiary Group (x10): $20 each (20%)

### FOS Samurai (Mid Tier)

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unit Price | ~$13.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas |
| Paying Volume | 495 Units (5 Free) |
| Protocol Revenue | $6,435 ($13 × 495) |
| Allocated Rewards | $5,000 |
| Ops Margin | $1,435 |

**Distribution Structure:**
- Primary Recipient: $2,500 (50%)
- Secondary Group (x6): $250 each (30%)
- Tertiary Group (x10): $100 each (20%)

### FOS Noble (Premium Tier)

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unit Price | ~$25.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas |
| Paying Volume | 495 Units (5 Free) |
| Protocol Revenue | $12,375 ($25 × 495) |
| Allocated Rewards | $10,000 |
| Ops Margin | $2,375 |

**Distribution Structure:**
- Primary Recipient: $5,000 (50%)
- Secondary Group (x6): $500 each (30%)
- Tertiary Group (x10): $200 each (20%)

## The Referral Activation

Users may optionally activate the Affiliate Protocol to participate in the growth economy.

**Activation Cost:** A fixed fee of $10.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas.

**Revenue Split:** The smart contract automatically routes 82% of generated fees to the referrer and 18% to the protocol treasury.

## The Sunset Protocol (365-Day Failsafe)

To prevent "Zombie Pools" or indefinite lock-ups, the protocol enforces a hard-coded 12-Month Liquidation Trigger.

**The Trigger:** If a cycle does not reach 500 mints within 365 days.

**The Action:** A public function liquidatePool() becomes callable.

**The Result:** The accrued Reward Pool is immediately distributed to the current participants (using the standard probability weights), and the cycle resets. This guarantees that user funds are never trapped.
