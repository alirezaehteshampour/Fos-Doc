# The Affiliate Protocol (Referral System)

## Architecture Overview

The Fos Affiliate Protocol is a decentralized growth engine designed to reward community expansion. Unlike traditional multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, this system is Single-Level and Linear, ensuring sustainability and preventing pyramid structures.

## Activation Pathways

Users participate in the growth economy via two distinct on-chain methods:

### Method A: The Partner Route (Via Referral Link)

**Mechanism:** A new user activates their account using an existing member's code.

**Cost:** $10.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas.

**Smart Contract Split:** The protocol automatically divides the fee:
- 82% ($8.20): Allocated to the Referrer.
- 18% ($1.80): Allocated to the Protocol Treasury.

### Method B: The Direct Route (No Referral)

**Mechanism:** A user joins the platform independently without an invite code.

**Cost:** $10.00 (ETH Equivalent) + Gas.

**Smart Contract Split:**
- 100% ($10.00): Allocated to the Protocol Treasury (as no referrer exists to compensate).

## Commission Distribution (Pull Pattern)

To optimize gas efficiency and security for high-volume referrers, the protocol utilizes a "Claim-Based" (Pull) architecture for commissions.

**Instant Allocation:** Commissions are calculated and added to the referrer's on-chain balance immediately upon the invitee's transaction.

**User-Controlled Withdrawal:** Referrers may withdraw their accrued earnings at any time via the withdraw() function. This prevents "Dust Attacks" and reentrancy vulnerabilities associated with automatic push payments for frequent earners.

**No Human Intermediary:** The entire ledger is managed by the smart contract; the Admin cannot freeze, delay, or manually adjust earned commissions.

## The Economic Growth Engine (Affiliate Math)

### The "Fair-Share" Architecture

The Fos Affiliate Protocol eliminates the complexity of opaque, multi-level marketing schemes. It relies on a transparent, Single-Level Protocol Economy where rewards are mathematically fixed and verifiable.

**Universal Activation:** Participation requires a standardized activation fee of $10.00 (ETH Base).

**The 82/18 Immutable Split:** The smart contract enforces a hard-coded revenue division for every referral event:
- Referrer Share (82%): $8.20 is allocated directly to the inviter.
- Protocol Share (18%): $1.80 is allocated to the Operational Treasury.

### Illustrative Fee Allocation Example (Non-Income)

Referral allocations are protocol-defined fee splits for promotional participation. They do not represent wages, investment returns, or guaranteed income. The system places no cap on the number of active connections a user can maintain ("Unlimited Width"), allowing for exponential individual growth within a linear system.

**Unit Economics:**

| Activations | Earnings |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $8.20 |
| 10 | $82.00 |
| 100 | $820.00 |
| 1,000 | $8,200.00 |

The Affiliate Protocol is single-level, non-recursive, and does not reward downstream activity beyond direct referrals. No pyramidal compensation structure exists.

### Real-Time Settlement Layer

Unlike traditional affiliate platforms that rely on monthly "Net-30" batch processing, the Fos Protocol operates on Block-Time Settlement.

**Instant Allocation:** Earnings are recorded on the internal ledger immediately upon the successful confirmation of the invitee's transaction.

**Claim-Based Efficiency:** To minimize gas costs for power users and prevent reentrancy attacks, the system utilizes a "Pull" Withdrawal Pattern. Users may aggregate earnings and withdraw to their wallet in a single transaction at their discretion.

Referral allocations are derived solely from protocol fees paid for activation and are not dependent on NFT purchase outcomes.
