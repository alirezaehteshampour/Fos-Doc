# Referral Program

The FOS Affiliate Protocol is a single-level referral system that rewards community growth.

---

## How It Works

1. **Activate:** Pay a one-time $10 fee (in ETH) to activate your referral account
2. **Share:** Get your unique referral link
3. **Earn:** Receive 82% of each direct referral's activation fee

### The 82/18 Split

| Recipient | Percentage | Amount |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Referrer (You) | 82% | $8.20 |
| Protocol | 18% | $1.80 |

## Key Features

### Single-Level Only

This is **NOT** multi-level marketing. You only earn from direct referrals. There are no tiers, no downstream earnings, and no pyramid structure.

### Instant Allocation

Commissions are calculated and added to your on-chain balance immediately when your referral completes their activation.

### Pull-Based Withdrawal

Your earnings accumulate in the smart contract. Withdraw anytime via the `withdraw()` function in the UI. This design prevents dust attacks and is gas-efficient for active referrers.

### Unlimited Referrals

There is no cap on how many people you can refer. Grow your network as large as you want.
