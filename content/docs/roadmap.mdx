# Public Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Community Introduction & Whitelist Access Program

This phase focuses on onboarding the first members of the ecosystem and establishing a foundation of verified early supporters.

- Launch of the official website and ecosystem overview
- Introduction of the FOS Protocol across the community channels
- Opening of the Whitelist Access Program for early adopters
- Participation-based tasks designed to help users learn about the platform and engage with the community
- Whitelisted users receive priority access to the next participation stage

The Whitelist is a contribution-based access layer, not a financial feature. It is designed to recognize genuine community participation rather than speculation.

## Phase 2 — Genesis Free-Mint Access (Whitelisted Users Only)

Following the whitelist period, a dedicated Free-Mint Campaign is opened exclusively to verified members.

- Whitelisted users may mint selected FOS Digital Collectibles
- Participation requires network gas only (no protocol fee during this window)
- All assets minted retain the same utility, provenance registration, and eligibility characteristics as standard mints
- The objective of this phase is to reward early contributors and establish the first active user base

This phase reinforces our principle of accessibility and loyalty recognition, while remaining fully aligned with the protocol's product-first architecture.

## Phase 3 — Limited-Access Application Release (Stability Validation Stage)

Before enabling full public access, the platform enters a restricted availability period.

- The application is opened to a limited number of users
- System performance, UX behavior, and contract execution are monitored
- Feedback from real-world usage is incorporated
- Technical and operational stability are validated

Only after the protocol demonstrates reliability in this controlled environment does the platform proceed to full availability.

## Phase 4 — Public Launch & Open Access

After stability validation, the protocol becomes publicly accessible.

- Full public access to the application
- Ongoing onboarding of new participants
- Continued growth through community-driven initiatives
- Expansion of ecosystem transparency and engagement tools

The system operates autonomously through its on-chain lifecycle and immutable logic, without centralized intervention.

## Phase 5 — Growth Campaign (Activated at 5,000 Users)

Once the ecosystem reaches 5,000 verified participants, the protocol activates a time-limited Growth Campaign Layer as defined in the technical and economic documentation.

- The campaign operates for a predefined time window
- The protocol redirects its Protocol Share allocation into a dedicated Community Reward Pool
- Distributions occur based on milestone thresholds
- Allocation follows a published structure and is tied to leaderboard performance and contribution ranking

Participation in the campaign is optional, does not affect product purchase consideration, and remains strictly promotional in nature.

## Phase 6 — FOS Lab: Innovation Playground

FOS Lab is where new ideas are born, tested, and refined together with the community.

This is a controlled experimental environment where we introduce and test new participation mechanics, new pool structures, and new interaction models — without affecting the stability of the live system.

**What users get:**
- Early access to experimental features
- A safe testing space separate from the main platform
- Opportunities to share feedback and influence feature development
- A community-driven innovation loop

FOS Lab is where ideas evolve into real features.

## Phase 7 — Desktop Experience Upgrade

FOS expands beyond mobile with a fully-optimized desktop experience designed for active users and long session interaction.

**What users get:**
- A redesigned interface for large screens
- Enhanced navigation and workspace layout
- Better visibility of cycles, history, and activity
- A smoother, more efficient user workflow

Whether you're on mobile or desktop, FOS delivers a consistent, high-quality experience.

## Phase 8 — Expanded Wallet Support

FOS becomes even more accessible by supporting a wider range of Web3 wallets.

**What users get:**
- Support for more browser and mobile wallets
- WalletConnect integration for universal access
- Smoother onboarding for new users
- Future-ready design for smart-wallet standards

Our goal is simple: use the wallet you like — and connect instantly.

## Phase 9 — Multi-Chain Expansion

FOS expands to compatible EVM networks through a security-first rollout strategy.

**What users get:**
- Access to FOS across multiple chains
- Faster transaction options depending on network
- Broader ecosystem participation
- Seamless experience across supported networks

Expansion follows a careful, audit-guided deployment path to ensure stability and trust.

## Phase 10 — Dashboard V2: Transparency Reinvented

Dashboard V2 introduces a new level of clarity, insight, and system visibility.

**What users get:**
- Deeper participation and engagement analytics
- Clear contribution and cycle activity views
- Historical timeline of ecosystem behavior
- Real-time system and transaction insights

Dashboard V2 strengthens our commitment to openness, fairness, and transparency.

## Phase 11 — Advanced User Profile

Built on the foundation of Dashboard V2, the Advanced User Profile transforms the wallet into a living participation identity.

**What users get:**
- Profile identity with optional avatar
- Personal activity timeline
- Participation footprint and engagement history
- Non-financial reputation indicators

Profiles reflect how users grow inside the ecosystem, not just what they hold.

## Phase 12 — Priority Access Mode

Active and committed users gain access to exclusive early-entry opportunities in selected cycles.

**What users get:**
- Early participation windows for top contributors
- Access opportunities based on engagement and consistency
- Recognition through participation effort — not entitlement
- Occasional access to special pools and events

This feature celebrates loyal members who help grow and support the ecosystem.

## Phase 13 — Loyalty Framework

A structured loyalty layer that acknowledges long-term participation and positive ecosystem behavior.

**What users get:**
- Progression based on engagement consistency
- Recognition for holding collectibles
- Participation-based milestones
- Community-value alignment

The loyalty framework is built on trust, contribution, and continuity.

## Phase 14 — Time-Based Digital Collectibles

Collectibles that evolve over time through progressive engagement and responsible holding behavior.

**What users get:**
- Unlockable attributes over time
- Holding-based collectible progression
- Optional transformation mechanics
- A visual reflection of participation history

Time becomes part of the collectible's story and identity.

## Phase 15 — Missions & Group Participation Quests

Participation becomes collaborative and goal-driven through personal and group missions.

**Individual Missions:**
- Engage across cycles
- Complete activity milestones
- Unlock progression achievements

**Group (Squad) Missions:**
- Team-based participation journeys
- Shared targets and milestones
- Cooperative progress experiences

This transforms ecosystem participation into an interactive community adventure.

## Phase 16 — Community Voting & Participation Governance

A gradual introduction of responsible user-driven decision participation.

**What users get:**
- Voting on selected feature proposals
- Participation-aligned voting conditions
- Optional gated voting groups
- Feedback-guided evolution of the ecosystem

Governance is introduced thoughtfully — step-by-step, with stability first.
