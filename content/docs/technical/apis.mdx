# APIs & Data Models

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/status` | GET | System health and current phases |
| `/allowlist/proof` | POST | Returns Merkle proof for a wallet |
| `/allocation/:wallet` | GET | Allocation eligibility and claim status |

## Application APIs

- **Transactions**: Saved post-mint via transaction handler API (wallet, tx hash, NFT details, amount).
- **Leaderboard**: `/api/leaderboard_handler.php` for podium/list and diagnostics (test/debug endpoints).
- **Profile**: `/api/profile_handler.php` for user profile data and referral info.
- **Explorer Sync**: Periodically read and cross-check user transactions and events from `BaseScan` for transparency.

## Schemas

- **User**: wallet, roles, preferences.
- **Mint**: tx hash, phase, amount, timestamp.
- **Allocation**: tier, allocation, claimedAt, tx hash.
