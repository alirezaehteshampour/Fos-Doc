# Technical Documentation

**Version:** v0.1 (Draft)  
**Audience:** Engineering, Product, Security  
**Scope:** Architecture, Contracts, Web App, Ops

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive, technical overview of **FOS**, covering smart contracts, the public landing website, and the main application. It is intended to be sufficiently detailed to form the basis of the project's whitepaper and related external documentation.

### Objectives

- Define the end-to-end architecture and component responsibilities.
- Describe minting, whitelisting, and allocation distribution mechanics.
- Explain security posture, operational processes, and testing strategy.

### Non-Goals

- Legal or tokenomics advisory beyond technical mechanisms.
- Marketing materials or visual brand guidelines.

## System Overview

### Architecture

The system comprises on-chain smart contracts, a public-facing landing site, and an authenticated main application. Off-chain services provide indexing, allowlist generation, and analytics. The architecture is modular to enable independent deployment and upgrades.

### Components

- **Smart Contracts**: Core token/NFT logic, whitelist verification, free-mint enforcement, and allocation settlement.
- **Landing**: Public marketing and interaction entry point with whitelist, free mint initiation, and allocation discovery.
- **Main App**: User dashboard, claims, admin controls, and operational tooling.
- **Off-chain Services**: Allowlist generation (e.g., Merkle trees), notifications, data indexing, and analytics.

### Network Choice: Base

- **Why Base?** Lower gas fees, high throughput, and robust L2 security inherit from Ethereum while providing a smoother UX.
- **Innovation**: We introduce a novel allocation distribution/referral construct on Base with no direct analogue among existing projects at time of writing.
- **Exploration & Analytics**: We read and verify transactions/events from `BaseScan` for user receipts, allocation tracking, and diagnostics.

## Landing Website

### Purpose & Structure

The landing site introduces the product, previews key application modules (Whitelist, Free Mint, Allocations), and routes users into the app.

### Tech Stack

- Server-rendered PHP templates with shared styles and components.
- Client-side JS enhances interactivity and integrates wallet connectors where needed.
- Calls internal APIs for dynamic counters and previews.

### Performance & SEO

- Static content where possible; defer non-critical scripts; cache API previews.
- Structured metadata, social cards, and Core Web Vitals monitoring.
