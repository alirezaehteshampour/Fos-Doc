# Verification Contract

Canonical registry for verifying project NFTs. Other contracts and off-chain services can query verification status.

## State & Configuration

- `isVerified[tokenContract][tokenId]` → bool.
- Authorized verifiers: `AccessControl` role `VERIFIER_ROLE`; admin can add/remove verifiers.
- Optional immutability flag to freeze verification after set, or versioned reasons for audits.

## External Interfaces

- `setVerified(tokenContract, tokenId, status, reason)` (verifier/admin).
- `isVerified(tokenContract, tokenId)` view function for integration.

## Verification Methods

- **On-chain**: Integrators call `isVerified` directly.
- **API**: An internal API endpoint returns verification status for UI and services.
- **Dedicated Page**: A web page lets users paste contract/token IDs and check verification status.

## Events & Security

- `VerificationChanged(tokenContract, tokenId, status, reason, msg.sender)`.
- Strict role gating; optional timelock for revocations; emit events for full auditability.
