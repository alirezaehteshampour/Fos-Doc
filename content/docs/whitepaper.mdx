## Key Highlights

### The Problem
Traditional reward and prize platforms operate as centralized intermediaries that extract 35-85% of value through operational overhead, trust costs, and profit margins.

### The Solution
FOS is an autonomous protocol that automates the entire reward lifecycle on-chain:
*   **Zero Human Discretion:** All outcomes determined by immutable smart contracts.
*   **Verifiable Randomness:** Chainlink VRF ensures tamper-proof recipient selection.
*   **97%+ Efficiency:** Only ~3% retained for protocol maintenance.

### The Technology
*   **Base Network (Ethereum L2):** Fast, low-cost, secure.
*   **ERC-721 NFTs:** Every collectible is a true, tradeable on-chain asset.
*   **Non-Custodial:** Users retain full control of their assets at all times.

### The Cycle of 500
Each cycle operates as a closed micro-economy:
1.  Participants mint NFTs (1-499).
2.  The 500th mint (Green Eye) triggers automated distribution.
3.  17 recipients selected via Chainlink VRF receive allocations.
4.  Cycle resets and continues perpetually.
