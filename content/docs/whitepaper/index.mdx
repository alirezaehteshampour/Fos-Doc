# Whitepaper

This document provides a comprehensive, technical overview of FOS, covering smart contracts, the public landing website, and the main application. It is sufficiently detailed to form the basis of the project's whitepaper and external documentation.

## Executive Summary

FOS is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to democratize access to NFT minting, create transparent prize distribution mechanisms, and provide a seamless user experience for both collectors and creators.

### Vision

To create a fair, transparent, and accessible blockchain ecosystem where users can participate in minting events, verify their eligibility through cryptographic proofs, and claim rewards with full on-chain verifiability.

### Mission

Build a modular, secure, and scalable platform that:
- Enables **free and whitelist-based minting** with anti-bot protections
- Provides **transparent prize distribution** with verifiable randomness
- Offers **premium user experience** through modern web technologies
- Maintains **security as a priority** through audited smart contracts

---

## Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **🎯 Fair Distribution** | Merkle-tree based whitelist verification ensures only eligible participants can mint |
| **🔒 Security** | Industry-standard smart contract patterns with comprehensive audit coverage |
| **⚡ Performance** | Gas-optimized contracts and CDN-backed frontend for blazing fast UX |
| **🌐 Accessibility** | Free mint options and subsidized transactions to lower barriers to entry |

### Goals

1. **Primary Goals**
   - Launch a secure, audited smart contract suite
   - Provide seamless whitelist registration and verification
   - Enable zero-cost minting for eligible participants
   - Implement fair and transparent prize distribution

2. **Secondary Goals**
   - Build comprehensive developer documentation
   - Create TypeScript SDK for easy integration
   - Establish community governance mechanisms

### Non-Goals

- FOS is **not** a generalized NFT marketplace
- We are **not** building custom Layer-2 solutions
- Real-time trading features are **out of scope** for v1.0

## System Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture separating on-chain and off-chain concerns:

### Component Overview

| Component | Description | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Core token/NFT logic, whitelist verification, prize settlement | Solidity, OpenZeppelin |
| **Landing** | Public marketing and interaction entry point | Next.js, React |
| **Main App** | User dashboard, claims, admin controls | Next.js, TailwindCSS |
| **Off-chain Services** | Allowlist generation, notifications, analytics | Node.js, The Graph |

---

## Token Economics

### NFT Distribution

1. **Whitelist Phase** - 40% of total supply reserved for verified whitelist participants
2. **Free Mint Phase** - 30% allocated for zero-cost minting with per-wallet limits
3. **Public Sale** - 20% available for public purchase at market price
4. **Team & Partners** - 10% reserved for team, advisors, and strategic partners

### Prize Pool Allocation

| Tier | Percentage | Distribution Method |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| Jackpot | 10% | VRF-based random selection |
| Gold | 20% | Top minters by volume |
| Silver | 30% | Random among all holders |
| Bronze | 40% | Participation rewards |

## Technology Stack

### Smart Contracts
- **Solidity ^0.8.20** - Latest security features
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** - Battle-tested implementations
- **Chainlink VRF** - Verifiable randomness for fair distribution

### Backend Services
- **Node.js** - High-performance API server
- **The Graph** - Blockchain indexing and querying
- **IPFS/Arweave** - Decentralized metadata storage

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with SSR/SSG
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first styling
- **wagmi/viem** - Web3 React hooks
- **WalletConnect** - Multi-wallet support

---

## Security Considerations

> **Warning**: Security is our top priority. All contracts undergo thorough auditing before mainnet deployment.

### Audit Program
- Pre-launch audit by professional auditors
- Continuous monitoring via Forta
- Bug bounty program on Immunefi

### Security Patterns
- Reentrancy guards on all external calls
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Access control with role separation
- Emergency pause functionality
