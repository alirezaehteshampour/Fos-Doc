# Objectives & Goals

This page outlines the specific objectives, measurable goals, and explicitly stated non-goals for the FOS platform.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Fair & Accessible Minting

Enable anyone to participate in NFT minting regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Zero-cost minting option for verified participants
- Simplified wallet connection and transaction signing
- Mobile-responsive minting interface
- Clear status indicators and transaction feedback

### 2. Transparent Verification

Implement cryptographic verification that is:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Provable** | All eligibility checks use Merkle proofs verifiable on-chain |
| **Auditable** | Complete transaction history available via block explorers |
| **Deterministic** | Same inputs always produce same verification results |

### 3. Secure Prize Distribution

1. **Prize Pool Funding** - Smart contract receives and locks prize funds with multi-sig admin control
2. **Random Selection** - Chainlink VRF provides verifiable, tamper-proof randomness for winner selection
3. **Claim Process** - Winners submit proof and claim prizes directly from the contract
4. **Settlement** - Funds transfer automatically with gas-optimized batch processing

## Non-Goals

> **Warning**: The following features are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial release.

### Not Building

1. **NFT Marketplace**
   - FOS is not a trading platform
   - Users can trade on OpenSea, Blur, etc.
   - No buy/sell/auction functionality planned

2. **Custom Blockchain**
   - Operating on existing L1/L2 chains only
   - No proprietary consensus mechanism
   - No custom token for gas

3. **Real-Time Trading**
   - No order book functionality
   - No automated market maker
   - No liquidity pools

4. **DAO Governance (v1)**
   - Initial governance is admin-controlled
   - Community governance planned for v2
   - Timelock for critical operations

### Technical Boundaries

Out of scope for v1.0:
- Cross-chain bridging
- Layer 2 rollup deployment
- Custom RPC infrastructure
- On-chain royalty enforcement

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Contract Security** | 0 critical vulnerabilities | Audit report |
| **Transaction Success Rate** | 99.5%+ | On-chain analytics |
| **Page Load Time** | Under 2 seconds | Core Web Vitals |
| **User Satisfaction** | 4.5/5+ rating | Post-mint surveys |
| **Documentation Coverage** | 100% of features | Internal tracking |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

> **Smart Contract Bugs**: Mitigated through comprehensive testing, audits, and bug bounty program.

- **Gas Spikes**: Implement gas price limits and batch processing
- **Network Congestion**: Prepare for high-demand scenarios with queue management
- **Dependencies**: Pin all external contracts to specific versions

### Business Risks

- **Low Adoption**: Pre-launch marketing and community building
- **Regulatory Changes**: Consult legal team, implement KYC where required
- **Market Conditions**: Flexible pricing and launch timeline
